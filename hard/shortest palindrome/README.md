# Shortest Palindrome

You are given a string s. You can convert s to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it.

Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.

Example 1:

Input: s = "aacecaaa"
Output: "aaacecaaa"
```

Example 2:

```

Output: "dcbabcd"
```

**Constraints:**
- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
- s consists of lowercase English letters only.
