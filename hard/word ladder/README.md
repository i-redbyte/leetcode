# Word Ladder

A transformation sequence from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of
words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
- Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
- sk == endWord Example 1:

```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= beginWord.length <= 10
- endWord.length == beginWord.length
- 1 <= wordList.length <= 5000
- wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
- beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
- beginWord != endWord
- All the words in wordList are unique.
