# Numbers With Repeated Digits #
Given a positive integer n, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that have at least 1 repeated digit.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 20
Output: 1
Explanation: The only positive number (<= 20) with at least 1 repeated digit is 11.
```

Example 2:
```

Output: 10
Explanation: The positive numbers (<= 100) with atleast 1 repeated digit are 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, and 100.
```

Example 3:
