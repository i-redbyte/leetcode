# Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: head = [0]
Output: 0
```

Example 3:

```
Input: head = [1]
Output: 1
```

Example 4:

```
Input: head = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 18880
```

Example 5:

```
Input: head = [0,0]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- The Linked List is not empty.
- Number of nodes will not exceed 30.
- Each node's value is either 0 or 1.
