# Factorial Trailing Zeroes #

Given an integer `n`, return the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.

Follow up: Could you write a solution that works in logarithmic time complexity?

Example1:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
```

Example2:
```
Input: n = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.
```

Example3:
```
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
```
Constraints:

- 0 <= n <= 10^4
