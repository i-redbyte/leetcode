#Power of Two
Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2^x.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 2^0 = 1
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 2^4 = 16
```

Example 3:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: false
```

Example 4:
```
Input: n = 4
Output: true
```

Example 5:
```
Input: n = 5
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
