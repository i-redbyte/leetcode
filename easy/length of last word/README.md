# Length of Last Word #

Given a string s consists of some words separated by spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. If the last word does not exist, return 0.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = " "
Output: 0
```

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
- s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '
