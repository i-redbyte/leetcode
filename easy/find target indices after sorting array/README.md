# Find Target Indices After Sorting Array

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and a target element target.

A target index is an index i such that nums[i] == target.

Return a list of the target indices of nums after sorting nums in non-decreasing order. If there are no target indices,
return an empty list. The returned list must be sorted in increasing order.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 2
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
The indices where nums[i] == 2 are 1 and 2.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 3
Output: [3]
Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
The index where nums[i] == 3 is 3.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 5
Output: [4]
Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
The index where nums[i] == 5 is 4.
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 1 <= nums[i], target <= 100
