# Available Captures for Rook

You are given an 8 x 8 matrix representing a chessboard. There is exactly one white rook represented by 'R', some number
of white bishops 'B', and some number of black pawns 'p'. Empty squares are represented by '.'.

A rook can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically (up, down, left, right) until it reaches another piece
or the edge of the board. A rook is attacking a pawn if it can move to the pawn's square in one move.

Note: A rook cannot move through other pieces, such as bishops or pawns. This means a rook cannot attack a pawn if there
is another piece blocking the path.

Return the number of pawns the white rook is attacking.
