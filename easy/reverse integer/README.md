# Reverse Integer

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the
signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

**Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).**

Example1:

```
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
```

Example2:

```
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
```

Example3:

```
Input: x = 120
Output: 21
```

Example4:

```
Input: x = 0
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

``` 
-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
```
