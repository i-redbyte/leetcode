# Add Strings #

Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

Example 1:
```
Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"
```

Example 2:
```
Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"

```

Example 3:
```
Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
Output: "0"
```

Constraints:
- 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 10^4
- num1 and num2 consist of only digits.
- num1 and num2 don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
