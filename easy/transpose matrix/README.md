Example 1:

```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
```

**Constraints:**
- m == matrix.length
- n == matrix[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 1000
- 1 <= m * n <= 10^5
- -10^9 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^9
