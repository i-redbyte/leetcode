Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)

```
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

Example 2:

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```

Example 3:

```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

Example 4:

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3
Output: 6
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10^9.
