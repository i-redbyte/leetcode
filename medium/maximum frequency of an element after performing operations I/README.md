# Maximum Frequency of an Element After Performing Operations I

You are given an integer array nums and two integers k and numOperations.

You must perform an operation numOperations times on nums, where in each operation you:

- Select an index i that was not selected in any previous operations.
- Add an integer in the range [-k, k] to nums[i].

Return the maximum possible frequency of any element in nums after performing the operations.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,4,5], k = 1, numOperations = 2

Output: 2

Explanation:

We can achieve a maximum frequency of two by:

Adding 0 to nums[1]. nums becomes [1, 4, 5].
Adding -1 to nums[2]. nums becomes [1, 4, 4].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [5,11,20,20], k = 5, numOperations = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

We can achieve a maximum frequency of two by:

Adding 0 to nums[1].
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
- 0 <= k <= 10^5
- 0 <= numOperations <= nums.length
