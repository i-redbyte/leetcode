# Count the Number of Fair Pairs

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size n and two integers lower and upper, return the number of fair pairs.

A pair (i, j) is fair if:

- 0 <= i < j < n, and
- lower <= nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [0,1,7,4,4,5], lower = 3, upper = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 fair pairs: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5).
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,7,9,2,5], lower = 11, upper = 11
Output: 1
Explanation: There is a single fair pair: (2,3).
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- nums.length == n
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- -10^9 <= lower <= upper <= 10^9
