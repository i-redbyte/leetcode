# Minimum Time Difference

Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any two time-points in the list.
 
Example 1:

```
Input: timePoints = ["23:59","00:00"]
Output: 1
```

Example 2:

```
Input: timePoints = ["00:00","23:59","00:00"]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**
- 2 <= timePoints.length <= 2 * 104
- timePoints[i] is in the format "HH:MM".
