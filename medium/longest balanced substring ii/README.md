# Longest Balanced Substring II
You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.

A **substring** of `s` is called **balanced** if all **distinct** characters in the **substring** appear the **same** number of times.

Return the **length of the longest balanced substring** of `s`.
Example 1:

**Input:** s = "abbac"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The longest balanced substring is `"abba"` because both distinct characters `'a'` and `'b'` each appear exactly 2 times.

Example 2:

**Input:** s = "aabcc"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The longest balanced substring is `"abc"` because all distinct characters `'a'`, `'b'` and `'c'` each appear exactly 1 time.

Example 3:

**Input:** s = "aba"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

One of the longest balanced substrings is `"ab"` because both distinct characters `'a'` and `'b'` each appear exactly 1 time. Another longest balanced substring is `"ba"`.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` contains only the characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.
